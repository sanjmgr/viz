# Data Visualization aka `viz`

## [What is data visualization and why is it important?](https://www.import.io/post/what-is-data-visualization/)

Data visualization is the representation of data or information in a `graph`, `chart`, or other `visual format`. It communicates relationships of the data with images. This is important because it allows `trends` and `patterns` to be more easily seen. With the rise of big data upon us, we need to be able to interpret increasingly larger batches of data.

Machine learning makes it easier to conduct analyses such as predictive analysis, which can then serve as helpful visualizations to present. But data visualization is not only important for data scientists and data analysts, it is necessary to understand data visualization in any career. Whether you work in finance, marketing, tech, design, or anything else, you need to visualize data. That fact showcases the importance of data visualization.

## Why do we need data visualization?

We need data visualization because a visual summary of information makes it easier to identify patterns and trends than looking through thousands of rows on a spreadsheet. Itâ€™s the way the `human brain works`.

Since the purpose of data analysis is to gain insights, data is much more valuable when it is visualized. Even if a data analyst can pull insights from data without visualization, it will be more difficult to communicate the meaning without visualization. Charts and graphs make communicating data findings easier even if you can identify the patterns without them.
